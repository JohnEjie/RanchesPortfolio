      <h3>Quality Assurance Specialist | Software Tester | Problem Solver</h3>
      <p>
        I'm John Ejie, a Computer Science graduate passionate about ensuring software quality and delivering reliable user experiences. My focus is on identifying issues before they reach production, improving product performance, and contributing to seamless, bug-free software releases.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my internship, I gained hands-on experience in manual testing, bug tracking, and QA documentation for web-based systems, including e-commerce and enterprise platforms. I collaborated with developers to ensure product stability and consistency, applying structured testing processes aligned with SDLC and Agile methodologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m continuously learning and currently exploring test automation, API testing, and DevOps practices to expand my QA capabilities and eventually grow into a Senior QA Engineer role.
      </p>
      <p>
        I take pride in being detail-oriented, analytical, and driven by quality — ensuring every product I test performs flawlessly for its users.
